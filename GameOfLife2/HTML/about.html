        <p>Designed and written by Oliver Foggin.</p>

        <p>This is a project I have been working on as a learning resource.  It is something I have been wanting to write for many years and is a good way of learning new optimisation techniques.</p>
        <p>My main aim is to try to create the first infinite Game of Life app for the iPhone.</p>
        <p>This is a huge update with a whole redesign of the UI.  Including a full colour picker and saveable settings.  Oh, and the map is now twice the size it was previously and can be zoomed and panned using two fingers to pinch zoom and pan!</p>
        <p>Enjoy and keep your reviews and suggestions coming!</p>
